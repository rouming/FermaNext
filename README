FERMANEXT DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN SUSPENDED.
WE ARE IN EXTREMELY NEED OF PEOPLE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN TRUSS CALCULATION MATH,
IN PRETTY GUI DEVELOPMENT OR IN RESEARCH OF TRUSS OPTIMIZATIONS.

PROJECTS
  FermaNext -- educational CAD software which performs strength analysis of a 2d
  structure made up by truss elements. Why is this software called educational?
  Because it was developed in Russian Moscow Aviation Institute to be a part of
  educational process. However, FermaNext does real 2d truss calculations and
  has many its own CAD distinctive features:

  · Analysis of 2D trusses
  · Supports all major measure units
  · Initial displacement conditions
  · Extremely easy model creation, no need to first define nodes and then
    elements, nodes are produced automatically
  · Top quality graphics rendering
  · Full GUI including
  · Every user action can be undoed with full history of actions
  · Immediate switch to other measure units
  · Easy model creation (members, loads, supports etc) in a user friendly
    environment with many graphical features
  · Definition of custom materials
  · Calculation and drawing of the deformed shape of the given model
  · Analytical view of the results of analysis, the geometry, the static model,
    the loads etc.
  · High quality analysis reports with all analysis results, including stress,
    internal forces and displacements diagrams, as well as drawings of the
    static model, its deformed shape and the axial-shear forces and moment
    diagrams
  . Truss unit structure optimization (genetic optimization is used for now)
  . Plugins architecture (with Java native bindings)
  . Portable to major of platforms: Windows, Linux, Mac OS (Wine support is
    required on Unix)
  . Live update support
  . Absolutely open source software

    LRSolver -- Laplace equation solver. TODO: full description
