LiveUpdate updates current local version of FermaNext app in cvs/svn manner.

TODO:

DONE>>  6. Disable cancellation while doing third step. (Deleting)

DONE>>  5. Set executable permissions for new or replaced binaries (actually on Unix only).

DONE>>> 4. Conflict resolving messages with full description what will be done.

DONE>>> 3. Conflict detection in subdirectories:

       <Directory status="deleted(delete)" name="dir_A_C_removed" >
            <Directory status="deleted(delete)" name="dir_A_C_A" >
                <Directory status="deleted(delete)" name="dir_A_C_A_A" >
                    <File status="deleted(delete)" md5="" name="file_A" />
                    <File status="deleted(delete)" md5="" name="file_B" />
                </Directory>
            </Directory>
            <File status="conflict(delete)" md5="" name="file_A" />
            <File status="deleted(delete)" md5="" name="file_B" />
       </Directory>

   It is obvious, that root directory 'dir_A_C_removed' can't be just deleted,
   because of the conflict in file 'dir_A_C_removed/file_A'

DONE>>> 2. Correct sorting of directory deletion jobs:

    DeleteJob (dir_A/dir_A_C_removed)
    DeleteJob (dir_A/dir_A_C_removed/dir_A_C_A)
    DeleteJob (dir_A/dir_A_C_removed/dir_A_C_A/dir_A_C_A_A)

   It is obvious, that firstly all files and subdirectories in directory 
   should be removed, and only then directory can be removed. 
   I.e. should be:

    DeleteJob (dir_A/dir_A_C_removed/dir_A_C_A/dir_A_C_A_A)
    DeleteJob (dir_A/dir_A_C_removed/dir_A_C_A)
    DeleteJob (dir_A/dir_A_C_removed)

DONE>>> 1. Correct progress counter with async jobs.
